Add weapons 
add items and picking them up (medkit, for example)

When I pick up a weapon, update my sprite so that I'm carrying it.

Add options - relative item drop frequency

When I pick up a weapon, and I alrady have two, drop one and leave it in the square, yeah?

Add capture the flag

Do we want different sound effects for missing vs hitting with a weapon?
or rather, swinging vs swining and hitting?
